what are you looking for in a software agency website?

# 2 Industry knowledge... You want to talk to people who understand your challenges

# 3 I don't know you, why would it make sense for me to take the time and trouble to talk to you?

# 4 Wow! You hit the nail on the head.... Who are you? Tell me more about your successes.. And yes, give me references or show me that you are a thought leader in this area

# 5 Yes! I feel good about this... Don't make it hard for me to get in touch with you... What should I do next? Some call it a "Call to Action!"
